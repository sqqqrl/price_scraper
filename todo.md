### 1) 1400 products. 
Have problem with category. Category link without filtres (brand, country, etc..) may consist of no more than 1400 products on the page. There are more than 1400 products in many categories.
No way to know who many products really exist. Total number of products is static, its not generated by code(backend just give you complete page).
At this point: add a "supplementable" param inside category model that says it is not compleated and can completed by scraping categories with filtres. 
### 2) add cli command to download and store sitemaps
### 3) restructure most of files
